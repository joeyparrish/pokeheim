It's some kind of deer, but it's way worse than it sounds.",

It's up to you.\n\nIf you have a <color=yellow>hammer</color>, somehow that can be used to build a <color=yellow>camp fire</color>.  Not sure how it works.  Odin's sloppy that way.  If you want to, you can camp out for the night.  Or you can just keep working by torchlight.  Torches never run out in Pokéheim!",

It will always be more efficient to craft those as quickly as you can, instead of carrying around raw materials.  Besides, there just aren't that many things to craft in Pokéheim.",

Odin is not what you might call \"detail-oriented\".\n\nBesides, you're in Pokéheim to catch monsters, not build houses!

If you fail, it's still a rock, so it'll do some damage.  The more damage you do, the easier a monster becomes to catch.  If it faints first, you'll catch it for sure.\n\nOh, but one word of advice: don't punch something you want to keep.  Punching your monsters is the only way to truly kill them.

After that, they will fight <color=yellow>for you</color>.\n\nCatch them again if you want to carry them around more easily, or press [<color=yellow><b>$KEY_Hide</b></color>] to recall them all at once.",
